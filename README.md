# Estimation of Runners' Number of Steps, Stride Length and Speed Transition from Video of a 100-Meter Race
The purpose of this study is sensing movements of 100-m runners from video that is publicly available, for example, Internet broadcasts. Normally, information that can be obtained from a video is limited to the number of steps and average stride length. However, our proposed method makes it possible to measure not only this information, but also time-scale information like every stride length and speed transition from the same input.
